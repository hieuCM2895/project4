# Project Overview

- In this project, you will apply the skills you have acquired in this course to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. This project tests your ability to operationalize a Python flask app—in a provided file, app.py—that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls.

## What does this project do?

- Run a docker container
- Upload container into a public registry (hub.docker.com)
- Run the deployed application in a Kubernetes cluster
- Integrate with CircleCI for continuous integration

## Requirements

- Python 3.7

## START HERE

### Step 0

- Fork this repo and clone it to your local workstation (obviously)

### Step 1: Install dependencies

- Set up the environment by running `make setup`. This will create a virtual environment in your home directory called `.devops`
- Install dependencies by running `make install`
- (Optionally) Lint application (requires hadolint)

### Step 2: Run Docker container

- Run the application on docker by calling `./run_docker.sh`

### Step 3: Upload to Docker Hub

- In the `./upload_docker.sh` file, edit the dockerpath (line 8) and change the docker username to a personalized one (or leave it as is, to use the public hieu2895/hieucm2project4)
- To upload to docker hub, run `./upload_docker.sh`

### Step 4: Kubernetes deployment

- To deploy to kubernetes, run `./run_kubernetes.sh`
